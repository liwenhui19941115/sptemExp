Title: Ensemble Spatiotemporal Mixed Models for Exposure Estimation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lianfa Li
Maintainer: Lianfa Li <lspatial@gmail.com>
Description: The approach of ensemble spatiotemporal mixed models is to make reliable estimation of air pollutant concentrations at high resolutions.
    This package is an ensemble spatiotemporal modeling tool with constrained optimization and also provides the functionality of grid mapping of air pollutants.
    Specifically, it includes the following functionality: 
    (1) Extraction of covariates from the satellite images such as GeoTiff and NC4 raster (e.g NDVI, AOD, and meteorological parameters);
    (2) Generation of temporal basis functions to simulate the seasonal trends in the study regions;
    (3) Generation of the regional monthly or yearly means of air pollutant concentration;
    (4) Generation of Thiessen polygons and spatial effect modeling;
    (5) Ensemble modeling for spatiotemporal mixed models, supporting multi-core parallel computing;
    (6) Integrated predictions with or without weights of the model's performance, supporting multi-core parallel computing;
    (7) Constrained optimization to interpolate the missing values; 
    (8) Generation of the grid surfaces of air pollutant concentrations at high resolution;
    (9) Block kriging for regional mean estimation at multiple scales.
